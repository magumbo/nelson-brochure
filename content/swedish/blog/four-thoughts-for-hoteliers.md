The hotel industry may not ever go back to the labor intensive business model. Manual check-in processes are not a good customer experience â€“ tech solutions are faster, more convenient and the customer is in control.

Old legacy Property Management Systems (PMS) with affordable quick fixes are not productive in the long run. They might be appealing at first sight, but in the long run it becomes tedious to maintain synergies across different services and tech solutions. Managing multiple applications in a browser is not the most productive approach, especially on smaller screens. Also the more integrations there are, the more vulnerable the system is.

Hoteliers should take data privacy seriously. Customers understand that data is valuable and that data is collected - however hotelers need to earn customers trust before collecting and analyzing the data. Personalisation is good for customers but their data privacy has to be treated with care.

Hoteliers should treat hard-working housekeepers like partners. They need to be empowered to do their job right - technology is no obstacle, but it needs to be user-friendly and specifically designed for the housekeepers including multi-language support. Housekeepers do not need a lot of middle-managers to do a good job - as long as the incentives are in place and support tools improve efficiency. Allowing for direct guest feedback for housekeepers makes their job more meaningful - they will take professional pride in ensuring that the rooms are in order.
